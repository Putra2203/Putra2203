# Hi, I'm Erdin! 👋 
*(Full-Stack Hybrid Developer | AI Researcher | Creative Soul)*

I’m a developer who doesn't just "write code"—I build systems that solve real problems. From architecting complex warehouse logistics to implementing deep learning models for medical monitoring, I bridge the gap between technical complexity and intuitive user experiences.

### 🌙 The Creative Side (My "Main Character" Energy)

When I'm not in a code editor, I’m exploring the intersections of art and language:
* **Dark & Poetic Writing:** I write stories with dark, melancholic themes, turning personal experiences and lyrics into prose.
* **TOEFL Mastery:** Currently crushing the **Structure & Written Expression** section to level up my global communication.
* **AI Art:** Experimenting with AI-driven 3D animations and image generation to push creative boundaries.
